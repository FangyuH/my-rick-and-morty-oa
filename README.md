This project is a simple Next.js application that fetches and displays character images from the Rick and Morty API. It allows you to view character images and navigate through pages of characters.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Rick and Morty Image Feed on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

### Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
npm install axios
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
npm install next/image
```

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FangyuH/my-rick-and-morty-oa.git
Run the development server:

npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
